# Boston Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the City of Boston using a regression-based machine learning model. It is built using Python’s scikit-learn library and leverages the well-known Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to train a model that can estimate the value of homes based on various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, accessibility to highways, and more.

The process begins with data loading, exploratory data analysis, and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. A variety of regression models were tested—including Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor—to evaluate their ability to generalize well on unseen data.

Model performance was assessed using standard regression loss functions such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provided insights into the accuracy of predictions and the model’s sensitivity to outliers. Visualizations were also created to compare actual vs. predicted prices and to interpret the most influential features.

This project serves as a hands-on application of core machine learning concepts, from model selection and evaluation to practical implementation using Python. It is ideal for beginners looking to understand the end-to-end pipeline of a supervised ML task.

You can explore the full code, comments, and visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. Contributions and suggestions are welcome as I continue to improve and expand on the project.
